Your formula for success has always been to fill the gaps in your skill set by drawing on the expertise of people in your social circle. This helps you make the most of the options presented to you, even when the window of opportunity is narrow. You’ll do what it takes to emerge ahead of your competitors. Being highly self-motivated allows you to keep exploring new pursuits no matter what the outcome may be. While taking time off to celebrate a significant milestone is important to you, you will not think twice before jumping right back into action if there’s something exciting on the horizon.",
